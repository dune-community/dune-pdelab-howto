PDELab Howto 2.0
================

This is the 2.0.0 release of PDELab, a PDE discretization toolkit built
on top of the DUNE framework [0]. License information can be found in the file
COPYING.

PDELab 2.0 is a major release containing a large number of new features and improvements.
Most importantly, the DOF handling and the interface to linear algebra have been completely
rewritten, bringing improvements like faster and more memory-efficient matrix pattern
construction, easier iteration over DOF vectors, built-in support for applying arbitrary
permutations to the DOF order, among others. Another important new feature is the ability
to do computations on non-overlapping grids without storing the ghost DOFs, reducing both
the parallelization overhead and the complexity of the underlying code, in particular when
using AMG. Finally, it is now possible to do adaptive calculations with nested function spaces.
For details and an overview of the bug fixes in this release, see the changelog below.

If you need help, please ask on our mailinglist [1]. Bugs can also be submitted
to the PDELab bugtracker at [2] instead.

******************************************************************************************
This release of PDELab is designed to work with the 2.3.1+ release of the DUNE libraries.

WARNING: Do not try to use PDELab 2.0 with the 2.3.0 release of the core modules as there
         are known issues, most importantly the AMG will not work!
******************************************************************************************

The dune-pdelab-howto package only contains example programs. You also need the
actual library package dune-pdelab and the support library dune-typetree.


Changes
=======

PDELab 2.0
----------

- The TypeTree library is now an external dependency. See README for information on
  how to obtain it.

- PDELab now supports building with CMake in addition to autotools.

- Many small adjustments to the examples to accomodate changes in the core modules and
  PDELab itself, most importantly

  - new vector and matrix backends
  - new matrix pattern construction method
  - new adaptivity implementation
  - new GridFunctionSpace VTK output mechanism
  - modified StationaryLinearProblemSolver constructors

- Documentation updates

- Some old and broken examples were removed, e.g. the mimetic finite differences examples
  that have not been working since before PDELab 1.1.

Releasy history

  - dune-pdelab-howto 2.0.0
    - Reduce number of LaTeX dependencies for building the Howto document.
    - Fix some issues in the boilerplate examples.
    - Documentation improvements.

  - dune-pdelab-howto 2.0.0-rc2
    - fix compilation of Howto document

  - dune-pdelab-howto 2.0.0-rc1
    - initial release candidate


PDELab 1.1
----------

This is the first release of PDELab after the move from Subversion to Git for
version control. You CANNOT find this release on the Subversion server. If you prefer
to directly check out the sources instead of using the provided tarballs, please see
our website for information on how to access the Git repository.

- The directory src/boilerplatetutorial contains a number of examples using the new
  boilerplate infrastructure layer from PDELab that is designed to reduce the amount
  of code required for writing standard PDELab programs.

- New example convection-diffusion/tutorial that also showcases the boilerplate
  infrastructure.

- We fixed most of the deprecation warnings due to deprecated APIs in the core modules.

- Fix for builds from repository with recent versions of autotools.

- Several bug fixes.

  - PDELab 1.1.0
    - Fix for cgstokes benchmark breaking the build if UG is not installed
    - Adaptivity example ported to new adaptivity infrastructure
    - Several updates to Howto text

  - PDELab 1.1-rc2
    - fix for compilation problem with boilerplate examples
    - build tarballs using GNU tar and make sure they work without automake installed

  - PDELab 1.1-rc1
    - initial release candidate

Caveats
=======

The following list is a non-exhaustive overview of possible problems you might
encounter with this release. This only lists problems specific to the
Howto. Please take a look at the release notes of dune-pdelab for issues
regarding the actual library.

Stokes
--------

* The cgstokes_instat example is currently broken (it does not even compile)
  and has been removed from the build process.

General
-------

* Compile times can be really long for non-trivial problems. Some developers
  have had good success with using the clang compiler instead of GCC during
  development and bug-testing to reduce compile times.

* If you are still using a *really* ancient version of PDELab, have a look at
  doc/README.changes for an overview of the major API changes that might keep
  your code from compiling.
